# The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry
### John Mark Comer


<!-- Comment -->
## Prologue: Autobiography of an epidemic

The author shares a tale of when he was trying to do something really hard. Specifically, lead / pastor a mega church. The tale starts when he started teaching 6 times each Sunday. If we were to generalize this story: when we try to do something really hard, what are they by products of those endeavors (which may or may not be similar to Comer).

- You spend so much time planning / strategizing in one area of your life, that the others are neglected.
    - Jesus
    - spouse
    - kids
    - friends
    - family
- When you are around those people (above), you just go through the motions instead of intentionally engaging with them, missing moments. What is life besides a series of moments.
- When you actually have "free time", your a zombie. You slip into "bad habbits" by nuturing bad habits.
- What the trajectory of this person described above in 5, 10, 20, 30 years?
    - someone who is really successful! But only on paper, measured by the "wrong" metrics.
    - Your soul will be empty and you'll be a spiritual infant who still drinks milk
    - Your kids will want nothing to do with you
    - You'll probably have a lousy marriage and have an affair
    - "You'll be too alive to die and too dead to live" - Byung-Chul Han
 
What if I changed my life?

- What if you measured your success based on new metrics?
- What if you stopped doing what your doing so you don't become the person you hate?
- What if you prioritized others besides yourself?
- What if you played with your kids?
- What if you picked up a hobby?
- What if I became an apprentice of Jesus?

Fears:
- What if people talk and say I gave up? "He ...
    - couldn't hack it
    - wasn't smart enough
    - wasn't tough enough
    - is wasting his gifts and talents
- Discount your self worth with XYZ
- I can't break the addiction... my mind just moves too fast.

Just Try. Make an effort to mature, even an inch.

Mathew xx: 7
```
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take
my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you
will find rest for your soulds. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
```

What if the secret to life is actually "easy" as Jesus claims. What if we are to take Jesus' yoke upon us, slow down our "life of speed" and find rest? Well then rather than buckle up, "settle in"!

## Part one: The problem
### Hurry: the great enemy of spiritual life

- Q: What do I need to become the me I want to be?
- A: You must ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life.
- Q: Okay what else?
- A: There is nothing else.

```
[The devil] is far more intelligent than we give him credit for. Today, your're
far more likely to run into the enemy in the form of an alert on your phone while
your reading your Bible or a multiday Netflix binge or a full-on dopamine addition
to instagram or a Saturday morning at the office or *another* soccer game on a
Sunday or commitment after commitment after commitment in a life of spped.
Corrie ten Boom once said that if the devil can't make you sin, he'll make you
busy. There's truth in that. Both sin and busness have the exact same effect -
they cut off your connection to God, to other people, and even to your own soul.
```

```
Hurry and love are imcompatible. All my worst moments as a father, a husband, and
a pastor, even as a human being, are when I'm in a hurry... I ooze anger, tension,
a critical nagging - the antitheses of love... Hurry and love are oil and water:
they simply do notn mix... There's a reason people talk about "walking" with God,
not "running" with God. It's because God is love.
