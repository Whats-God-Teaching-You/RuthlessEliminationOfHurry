# The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry
### John Mark Comer


<!-- Comment -->
## Prologue: Autobiography of an epidemic

The author shares a tale of when he was trying to do something really hard. Specifically, lead / pastor a mega church. The tale starts when he started teaching 6 times each Sunday. If we were to generalize this story: when we try to do something really hard, what are they by products of those endeavors (which may or may not be similar to Comer).

- You spend so much time planning / strategizing in one area of your life, that the others are neglected.
    - Jesus
    - spouse
    - kids
    - friends
    - family
- When you are around those people (above), you just go through the motions instead of intentionally engaging with them, missing moments. What is life besides a series of moments.
- When you actually have "free time", your a zombie. You slip into "bad habbits" by nuturing bad habits.
- What the trajectory of this person described above in 5, 10, 20, 30 years?
    - someone who is really successful! But only on paper, measured by the "wrong" metrics.
    - Your soul will be empty and you'll be a spiritual infant who still drinks milk
    - Your kids will want nothing to do with you
    - You'll probably have a lousy marriage and have an affair
    - "You'll be too alive to die and too dead to live" - Byung-Chul Han
 
What if I changed my life?

- What if you measured your success based on new metrics?
- What if you stopped doing what your doing so you don't become the person you hate?
- What if you prioritized others besides yourself?
- What if you played with your kids?
- What if you picked up a hobby?
- What if I became an apprentice of Jesus?

Fears:
- What if people talk and say I gave up? "He ...
    - couldn't hack it
    - wasn't smart enough
    - wasn't tough enough
    - is wasting his gifts and talents
- Discount your self worth with XYZ
- I can't break the addiction... my mind just moves too fast.

Just Try. Make an effort to mature, even an inch.

Mathew xx: 7
```
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take
my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you
will find rest for your soulds. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
```

What if the secret to life is actually "easy" as Jesus claims. What if we are to take Jesus' yoke upon us, slow down our "life of speed" and find rest? Well then rather than buckle up, "settle in"!

## Part one: The problem
### Hurry: the great enemy of spiritual life

- Q: What do I need to become the me I want to be?
- A: You must ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life.
- Q: Okay what else?
- A: There is nothing else.

Why? "Hurry" is the **root** problem underneath so many of the symptoms of toxicity in the world.

Page 20:
```
[The devil] is far more intelligent than we give him credit for. Today, your're
far more likely to run into the enemy in the form of an alert on your phone while
your reading your Bible or a multiday Netflix binge or a full-on dopamine addition
to instagram or a Saturday morning at the office or *another* soccer game on a
Sunday or commitment after commitment after commitment in a life of spped.

Corrie ten Boom once said that if the devil can't make you sin, he'll make you
busy. There's truth in that. _Both sin and busness have the exact same effect -
they cut off your connection to God, to other people, and even to your own soul._
```

Page 21:
```
The problem isn't when you have _a lot_ to do; it's when you have _too much_ to do
and the only way to keep up is to hurry. 
```

Hypothesis (page 21): It may be the case that ...

1. Christians are assimilating to a culture of busyness, hurry and overload, which leads to...
2. God becoming more marginalized in Christians' lives, which leads to...
3. a deteriorating relationship with God, which leads to...
4. Christians becoming even more vulnerable to adopting secular assumptions about how to live, which leads to...
5. more conformity to a culture of busyness, hurry and overload.

And then the cycle begins again.

Why does this matter? Well, remember that LOVE has the highest value in Christ's economy (recall: " love the Lord and love neighbor" were the highest commands). BUT because love is painfully time consuming, hurry & love are incompatible.
- We simply can't love each other well when we hurry.
- In fact, Paul's first descriptor of love is "patient".
- It's called "walking" w/ God, not "running w/ God"
- The same is true for joy & peace.


Page 23:
```
Hurry and love are imcompatible. All my worst moments as a father, a husband, and
a pastor, even as a human being, are when I'm in a hurry... I ooze anger, tension,
a critical nagging - the antitheses of love... Hurry and love are oil and water:
they simply do notn mix... There's a reason people talk about "walking" with God,
not "running" with God. It's because God is love.
```



Page 27:
```
We are 'distracting ourselves into spiritual oblivion.'

John Ortberg has said, "For many of us, the great danger is not that we renounce
our faith. It is that we will become so distracted and rushed and preoccupied
that we will settle for a mediocre version of it. We will just skim our lives
instead of actually living them."

Do you see what's at stake here?

### A brief history of speed

Here's a high level overview of the people & things that have sped up our lives:

Clocks
- The sundial
    - Cutting up man's day into smaller portions
- Saint Benedict
    - The monks organized the monastery around 7 times of prayer each day. BUT, they invented a mechanical clock to help keep track of when those prayer times were to commence.
- Clocks made our days more uniform, all year round. Summer days used to be long and winter short. But now they are all the same length according to the clock.
- We stopped listening to our bodies circadian rhythm and started rising to the tick tock of a clock, under the dominion of a machine.

Labor-saving devices
- before the light bulb was invented in 1879 by Thomas Edison, an average person got about 11 hours of sleep each night! American's average 7 now-a-days.
- HVAC! No more choppping down trees to heat your home with fire
- Cars
- Coffee pots
- Dishwashers
- Toaster
- Take out
- Email
- AI
  
Yay! We have more time! But where did it go? We spent it on other things.
- In the 1960's sci, people predicted American's would only be working 22 hour weeks by 1985. Welp, they were wrong. We actually work more.
- A measure of wealth used to be: More recreation! But now, it's more work. The more you sit around and relax, the less status you have.


- 7-eleven
- Steve Jobs
